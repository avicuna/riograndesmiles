    <h3 class="faq-question">Preventive Dentistry</h3>
    <div class="faq-content">
      <p><span class="bold">What can I do to keep my teeth healthy?</span></p>
      <p>Regular dental check-ups and cleanings, a balanced diet, and proper oral hygiene practices are essential.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">What toothpaste should I use?</span></p>
      <p>The most important ingredient to look for when choosing toothpaste is fluoride, which helps protect your teeth from decay.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">Why should I floss? Isn't brushing enough?</span></p>
      <p>Flossing removes plaque from between your teeth where a toothbrush can't reach, helping prevent gum disease and cavities.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">How can I prevent cavities?</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brush your teeth twice a day for at least two minutes.</li>
        <li>Limit sugary foods and drinks.</li>
        <li>Visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and check-ups.</li>
